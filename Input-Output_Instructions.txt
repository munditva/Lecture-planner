The program compiles on gcc compiler and does not require any other dependencies


Sample Input/Output:

Enter number of nodes: 5
Enter number of immdediate edges: 2
Enter the parent node of the i'th node: 
2 3 0 5 3
Enter immediate edges: 
1 5
5 4
Schedule found :
3 2 1 5 4 



Explanation:

The program first reads the number of nodes(N) and immediate edges(M). Note that M<N

Then, it reads N integers such that i'th integer is the parent node of the i'th node in the graph

Then, it reads the immediate edges as pairs (x,y) where there is an immediate directed edge from 
x to y 

After reading all the input the program outputs a possible schedule or indicates that no schedule exists
