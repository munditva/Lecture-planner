# Lecture-planner

##Quick Review of the problem for algorithm design:##

A course has to be designed such that each lecture has some prerequisite lecture to be done for better understanding of the current lecture. Similar situation might arise in an industry such that some jobs has some prerequisite jobs to be done so that the current job can be done efficiently

Given a rooted tree, where each parent node denotes a prerequisite job/lecture before a child job/lecture is done, find a valid planning of the jobs.

Also, there are some pair of jobs/lectures (x,y) such that job/lecture y has to be done immediately after the commencement of job/lecture x due to the demand of the industry/course. 

If there is a valid planning of jobs possible, print any such schedule.
